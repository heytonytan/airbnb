                    <h4 class="media-heading">Background</h4>
                    <p>Founded in 2008, Airbnb has developed into a mature hospitality sharing economy company, providing short-term stays in homes around the world. With over 2 million listings in over 190 countries, Airbnb’s host base is maturing, with popular homes in every major city, validated by numerous 5-star ratings and positive reviews.</p>

                    <p>With a developed host base, the Airbnb host community is facing saturation. The platform can only list a limited number of listings in each geographical area, and new hosts are finding it hard to differentiate themselves from experienced hosts. This would restrict growth of Airbnb host base, which would in turn constrain Airbnb’s overall growth.</p>

                    <p>With limited listing space on its platform, Airbnb must develop ways to give new hosts a good chance of building up a track record. Up against mature listings with validated ratings and reviews, promising new hosts need a differentiating factor to signal their quality.</p>

                    <p>That being said, how would Airbnb distinguish between the mediocre entrants from the promising ones? Would location be a factor? It would be useful if the platform could somehow discern between the good from the bad entrants. Otherwise, it would be placing possibly mediocre listings ahead of good and experienced listings, which would otherwise give users a better experience.</p>

                    <p>This brings about the basis of our project. Applying data science techniques to Airbnb’s data, we will see if we can predict the popularity of listings.</p>

                    <p>A wealth of home listing data is available on the Airbnb platform. With this data, we will apply a range of data science techniques to see if we are able to develop accurate predictions of whether a listing is popular.</p>

                    <p>Should we find that we can predict popularity with reasonable accuracy, we will suggest a feature on the Airbnb platform to boost promising new listings.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to <em><a href="http://insideairbnb.com/">Murray Cox</a></em>, there is extensive Airbnb data available online. From the numerous data fields, we will focus on 4 areas:</p>

                    <p><strong>a) Listings attributes</strong> - Fields that present the various attributes of the listing, including location, home type, price, amenities, capacity, costs, etc.</p>

                    <p><strong>b) Host attributes</strong> - Detailed information on the quality and behavior of the Airbnb host.</p>

                    <p><strong>c) Text descriptions</strong> - Extensive text data describing details of the home, neighbourhood, means of transport, etc.</p>

                    <p><strong>d) Ratings and reviews</strong> - Review scores covering various aspects of the listing, such accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, and value.</p>

                    <p>SF is the home city of Airbnb, and is currently one of the most fascinating real estate markets in the world. With the tech industry fuelling housing prices and rentals, Airbnb has grown into a way which homeowners list their homes or rooms for short-term stays in order to parlay their housing costs. The Airbnb landscape is comparatively developed in SF, which makes it a suitable city to study as a mature listings community.</p>

                    <p>Using the latitude and longitude fields, we are able to geographically plot the listings and observe the distribution of listings in San Francisco. In general, the listings are concentrated in the north-east region of the city, with an outward radial dispersion towards the west and southward areas. Clustering the listings using DBSCAN, we are able to observe that there is a extended saturated region in the central to north-eastern part of SF. with the city fringes as perpheral clusters.</p>

                    <p>Charting a density scatterplot by price vs. popularity, we observe that listings tend towards the $50 to $150 per bed range. This is interesting, as it suggests that many Airbnb listings are offered as lower-end accomodation, and compete on a different price point as compared to hotels.</p>

                    <p>Fitting the price data to a logistic regression showed that if a listing was priced beyond a certain point, an Airbnb listing was bound to be unpopular. At the same time, high-priced listings might have intended to position themselves as high-margin and low-volume.</p>

                    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Decision Trees</h4>

                    <p>Applying decision trees, we found that the RMSE is minimised when max depth was 4, and that ratings, price, and host were the most important factors in determining popularity. While we were surprised to know that the space did not factor as strongly, this made sense to us, as the price determined the net value, and the host determined the quality of experience that an Airbnb user would get. Applying random forests, we derived the similar conclusion.</p>

                    <p>From this, we observed that the main quantitative discriminant of popularity for a new listing might just be price. If it falls within a particular band, it has the chance of becoming popular. Beyond a certain price band, it may have to expect booking volumes as a niche listing. Hence, there could be potential to recommend a price band for listings in a particular area.</p>

                    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Naive Bayes</h4>

                    <p>From the structured description data, we were able to apply Naive Bayes to find something interesting. With a ngrams of n=2, we were able to observe that the predictive ability of the vectorised vocabulary is surprisingly high, of up to 70% and above. With the text data, we can predict with reasonable accuracy whether a listing would be popular.</p>

                    <p>Initially, we assumed that Airbnb hosts wrote their own listing information. Upon asking friends who were Airbnb hosts, we learned that when hosts put up listings, they do receive help from Airbnb to flesh out the listing descriptions. Hence, interesting follow up work could be done to develop further understanding of the text. For instance, particular words could contribute to popularity, making it a copywriting problem; the text could reflect particular attributes that reflect the inherent popularity of the listings.</p>

                    <p>In the meantime, if we could take the description listings and run naïve bayes through it, we could in the meantime have a reasonably good predictor of popularity.</p>

                    <p>Clustering was observed to be useful for discovering archetypes in the data, especially when the data fields are listing attributes.</p>

                    <p>To apply the insights to the actual Airbnb platform, we can use the description field as a predictor of the popularity of new listings. For the listings that have a good chance of becoming a popular listing, the Airbnb platform should promote them to give them some opportunity of being considered by an Airbnb user. This could come in the form of a “Fresh!” tag on the Airbnb page.</p>
